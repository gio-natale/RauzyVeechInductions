# RauzyVeechInductions
Calculates the Minkowski question-mark function and generates Rauzy-Veech induction preimages to spot patterns in their distribution.

Minkowski.py calculates the Minkowski question-mark function (cf. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski%27s_question-mark_function).

Induction.py finds all the Rauzy-Veech induction pre-images without repeating permutations and collects all such generated points on the (0,1) interval to plot their distribution (cf. https://arxiv.org/abs/0710.5614).
